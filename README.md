# Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
An interactive Streamlit application to predict used car prices based on user-input features. Built using Python and machine learning techniques.

---

### Key Features
- Predict used car prices based on features like make, model, year, etc.
- User-friendly Streamlit application.
- Machine learning models optimized for accuracy.

---

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-dheko-price-prediction.git
2.Run the Streamlit application:
    streamlit run app.py

## Project Structure
data/: Contains datasets for different cities.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model development.
scripts/: Scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and deployment.
app.py: Streamlit application code.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies.

## Methodology
1.Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Standardizing numerical features.
2.EDA:
Visualizations and feature analysis.
3.Model Development:
Regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forests, etc.
Model evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, R-squared.
4.Deployment: Streamlit for web app.

## Results
Best Model: Random Forest Regressor (MAE: XX, R-squared: XX)
Interactive application for real-time predictions.
